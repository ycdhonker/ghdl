Description: VHDL compiler/simulator
 GHDL is an open-source simulator for the VHDL language.
 .
 VHDL is a language standardized by the IEEE, intended for developing
 electronic systems. GHDL fully supports IEEE 1076-1987, IEEE 1076-1993,
 IEEE 1076-2002 and partially supports the 1076-2008 version of VHDL.
 .
 GHDL compiles VHDL files into executable code. The resulting program,
 when executed, simulates the electronic design. GHDL is not a synthesizer:
 it does not translate VHDL into a netlist.
 .
 GHDL and its compiled programs are command-line tools. The simulations can
 optionally write VCD files which may be opened in an external waveform viewer
 such as gtkwave. Combined with a waveform viewer and a text editor, GHDL is
 a very powerful tool for writing, testing and simulating your VHDL code.
 .
 GHDL supports several code generation backends; this package uses the LLVM
 backend.
